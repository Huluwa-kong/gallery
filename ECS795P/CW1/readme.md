# ECS795P Deep Learning and Computer Vision, 2023

## Course Work 1: Image Super-resolution Using Deep Learning

Aim: To obtain practical knowledge and hands-on understanding of the concepts of
image super-resolution, deep learning using convolutional neural networks (CNN)
and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).
Start: Download CW1_ECS795P.zip from the course website at
http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~sgg/_ECS795P_/.

Tasks: three subtasks are involved:
1. Coding: to add your code blocks in the required sections; (40% of this CW)
2. Report: to complete the questions in report; (30% of this CW)
3. Online assessment: to answer one question and to conduct one exercise,
which are randomly selected from below. It will be carried out during the
lab demo session in WK10; (30% of this CW)

Platform: Python + PyTorch

1. Understanding image super-resolution

Objective: To become familiar with the image super-resolution problem setting.
Questions:
1. What is the concept of image resolution?
2. What is the gray-scale or single-channel image super-resolution?
3. What is the Ground Truth image?
4. How to measure the quality of the output high-resolution images?

Exercises:
1. To read the image named butterfly_GT.bmp
2. To show the image resolution of this image
3. To convert the image from the RGB colour space into the gray-scale space
(Tip: use imageio package to read image)
4. To downsample the current image by 3 times
5. To upsample the current image by 3 times with interpolation algorithm
